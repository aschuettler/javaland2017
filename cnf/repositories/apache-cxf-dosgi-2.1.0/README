Welcome to the Apache CXF Distributed OSGi DSW Reference Implementation
=======================================================================


The dOSGi subproject of Apache CXF provides the Remote Services Specification version 1.0,
 Chapter 13 in the OSGi Compendium Specification, and OSGi Remote Service Admin Specification
version 1.0, Chapter 122 in the OSGi Enterprise Specification[1].

This release is provided for your convenience in two distribution formats:

1. Multi-bundle distro

Contains the dOSGi implementation and all 3rd party dependencies as
separate bundles within an archive. The current distribution is an
instance of this type. The easiest way to get started is to explode
this archive into your Felix or Equinox installation tree. Then
append the contents of the felix.config.properties.append or
equinox.config.ini.append snippets found in the conf directory to
your felix.config.properties or equinox.config.ini. This will cause
all the required bundles to be loaded on start-up. The bundles required
for the Zookeeper-based Discovery Service implementation are also provided
in this distribution, and similarly may be automatically loaded by
appending the felix.discovery.config.properties.append or
equinox.discovery.config.ini.append snippets as appropriate.


2. Source distro

Contains the entire source tree for dOSGi.

Regards,
The CXF dOSGi team.
